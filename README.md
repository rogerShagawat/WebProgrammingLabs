# Web Programming Labs
This is all the lab work I did for my class at Stevens Web Programming.

We went through how to build a website from basic HTML JS and CSS all the way to using Node.js and postman to test our code, make our websites secure, and learn the fullstack process of designing, building, and maintaing a website.

Take a look through my work if you'd like to see what I did!
